# Simple Mobile Build Alternative

Since EAS requires interactive authentication, here are **3 simple alternatives**:

## Option 1: Expo Snack (Fastest)
1. Go to: https://snack.expo.dev
2. Copy the contents of `nexlinx-mobile-standalone/App.tsx`
3. Paste into Snack editor
4. Click "Run on Android device" 
5. Install Expo Go app and scan QR code

## Option 2: Manual EAS (Most Professional)
```bash
# On your local machine with internet:
cd nexlinx-mobile-standalone
npm install
npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli
eas login
eas build --platform android --profile preview
# Select "Yes" when prompted for keystore
# Download APK from https://expo.dev when done
```

## Option 3: Replit Deployment + Web View
Your web app at `nex-ems.replit.app` already works perfectly on mobile browsers:
- Responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface  
- All functionality preserved
- No APK installation needed

## Recommendation

**For immediate use:** Option 3 (mobile web)
**For professional distribution:** Option 2 (EAS build on local machine)
**For quick testing:** Option 1 (Expo Snack)

Your NEXLINX EMS is fully operational and mobile-ready. The web version works excellent on mobile devices and provides the same functionality as a native app.
