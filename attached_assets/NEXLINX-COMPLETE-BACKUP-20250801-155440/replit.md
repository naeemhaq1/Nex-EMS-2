# Nexlinx Employee Management System

## Overview
The Nexlinx Employee Management System is an advanced, mobile-first platform designed to provide a robust and high-performance administration experience across various devices. It aims to streamline employee management processes, leveraging cutting-edge mobile technologies. The project's vision is to deliver resilient and performant solutions for workforce management.

## User Preferences
- **CRITICAL: Always ask permission before making structural/architectural changes**
- **ABSOLUTE RULE: 3-POLLER SYSTEM AND DATA PROCESSING FROM STAGING TO FINAL ATTENDANCE IS NOT TO BE TOUCHED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM**
- Never consolidate or modify core services (data processing, polling systems) without explicit approval
- Data processing and pulling services (unifiedAttendanceProcessingService, threePollerSystem) must remain completely untouched
- Focus on deployment readiness and production optimization
- Prefer EAS CLI direct builds over GitHub Actions (faster: 5-10 min vs 15-20 min)
- Multiple builds needed for iterative development - Expo Starter plan recommended
- Resolve dependency conflicts properly rather than workarounds
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/naeemhaq1/Nex-EMS-Web
- Minimize Docker image size for successful deployment
- Preserve all essential application functionality
- Clean project structure without unnecessary files

## System Architecture
**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **CRITICAL DESIGN STANDARD**: Dark purple and blue theme must be followed for ALL interfaces.
    - **FORBIDDEN COLORS**: Yellow, brown, orange buttons are prohibited unless representing status indicators.
    - **APPROVED COLORS**: Dark purple gradients, indigo, blue variants, and purple accents only.
    - **STATUS EXCEPTION**: Orange/yellow/red only allowed for status indicators (urgent, warning, error states).
    - **CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT**: All buttons, cards, gradients must use purple/blue color palette.
- Professional avatars are used system-wide, generated based on gender (limited female options) and designation.
- Data density is optimized across interfaces, particularly for the WhatsApp desktop console, to maximize information display in a full-screen layout.
- Responsive design is prioritized for all components, adapting to mobile and desktop views.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: The application is structured into three tiers for minimal interference and service isolation:
    - **Port 5000**: Main web interface and general APIs.
    - **Port 5001**: Core services (attendance, monitoring, backup, polling).
    - **Port 5002**: WhatsApp services (messaging, chatbot, monitoring, contacts).
- **Frontend**: React web application with mobile-responsive design.
- **Backend**: Express.js with PostgreSQL database.
