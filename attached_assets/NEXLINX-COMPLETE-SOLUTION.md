### Option 2: Native APK (Manual Build Required)

**Issue**: EAS requires interactive authentication not available in automated environment

**To build manually**:
1. On local machine with internet: `eas login`
2. Run: `eas build --platform android --profile preview`
3. Download APK from Expo dashboard

## Recommendation

Deploy your web platform immediately - it provides complete mobile functionality without requiring APK installation. The native app can be built later if desired.
